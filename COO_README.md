# Claude Analytics for Executives

## One-Time Setup (2 minutes)
```bash
./coo-setup.sh
```

## Your Two Tools

### 1. Check Dashboard (anytime)
```bash
dashboard
```
Shows:
- Today/Week/Month metrics
- Current health status

### 2. Ask Questions (when confused)
```bash
why "sessions are low today"
why "costs spiked yesterday"
why "john isn't using Claude"
```

## That's It!

No SQL. No complexity. Just:
1. Look at numbers: `dashboard`
2. Ask why: `why "something looks wrong"`

## Examples

**Morning check:**
```bash
dashboard
# See low numbers
why "only 3 sessions this morning"
# Get explanation
```

**Cost investigation:**
```bash
what "is driving costs"
how "much did we spend yesterday"
```

**User tracking:**
```bash
who "used Claude most this week"
why "is sarah not using Claude anymore"
```
