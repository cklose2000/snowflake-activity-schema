IMPORTANT: This is for an executive dashboard. Prioritize:
1. Use V_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY for high-level metrics
2. Include totals, averages, and percentages
3. Format numbers nicely (K for thousands, M for millions)
4. Sort by importance/recency
5. Limit results to meaningful insights (usually top 10-20)

Executive is asking: $QUERY"
